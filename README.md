## Dice_Game



A two player game designed to be played with a friend or against the computer. In this game there is a six faced die that is used. The players will take turns rolling a six face die until someone reaches one-hundred and wins the game. When it is the players turn they have option to roll or hold. If the player rolls a number between two and six it is added to their score. If a player scores a one their score resets to zero.  If the player plays against the computer they have the option to pick difficulty levels. The same rules apply and the first one to one-hundred wins the game.
