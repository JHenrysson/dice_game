**To Generate the UML & Package Diagrams**

Run these commands in terminal 

To ensure on correct directory 
<br>

``cd dice``

Next 

``make pyreverse``
<br>

This command creates two .dot files, one for classes and one for packages. 
These are converted into two png files located in doc/pyreverse.


### Generating Documentation 
For this project **make doc** is used
In the console type in the following commands 
<br>

To make sure you are on the correct directory
<br>

``cd dice ``
<br>

Next <br>

``make doc``

This should generate html files in the projects folder. 
You can view these files in your IDE or opening them
in the browser
